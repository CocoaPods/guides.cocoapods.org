<h2 id="cocoapods-media-pack">CocoaPods Media Pack</h2>

<p><em>Note</em> We use a capital <em>P</em> in CocoaPods, it&#39;s an uphill battle, but worth it :D</p>

<p>So you want to use the CocoaPods logo? Ace.</p>

<p>1st off we have the vectors in <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/shared_resources/tree/master/design/sketch">Sketch format</a>.</p>

<p>Next up, the Logo in order of our preference. </p>

<p><img src="/shared/media/cocoapods-orange-on-grey.jpg" alt="Cocoapods Orange On Grey" /></p>

<p><img src="/shared/media/cocoapods-white-on-orange.jpg" alt="Cocoapods White On Orange" /></p>

<p><img src="/shared/media/CocoaPods-black-on-white.png" alt="CocoaPods Black On White" /></p>

<p>Then if you&#39;re just using CocoaPods in reference to some other tools, it may make sense to use our twitter avatar:</p>
